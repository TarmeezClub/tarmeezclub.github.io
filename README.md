## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with contributing to our repository, you'll need to have a basic understanding of Git and GitHub. Don't worry if you're not a pro, we all started somewhere!

### Prerequisites
- Git installed on your machine
- GitHub account

First things first, make a clone of the repository:
```

## 🌳 GitFlow Workflow

We use the GitFlow branching strategy. It helps us manage our development process more smoothly and keeps our main branch free of unfinished features.

### Quick GitFlow Guide

1. **Main Branch**: This is our source of truth. All the released features are here. 🎉

2. **Develop Branch**: This is where we integrate our new features. Think of it as a preparation branch for our next release. 🛠️

3. **Feature Branches**: Whenever you start working on a new feature, branch off from `develop`:
    ```
    git checkout develop
    git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
    ```
   Code your heart out on your feature! When you're done:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "A descriptive message about your feature"
    git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
    ```

4. **Pull Requests**: When you feel your feature is ready, create a pull request from your feature branch to `develop`. The team will review it, and once it's approved, it will be merged. 👍

5. **Release Branches**: When we decide to make a release, we create a release branch off of `develop`. Once it's ready and tested, it's merged into `main` and tagged with a version number. 🏷️

6. **Hotfix Branches**: If we find a bug in `main`, we create a hotfix branch. Once fixed, it's merged to both `main` and `develop`. 🚑

### Helpful Commands

- Creating a new feature branch:
  ```
  git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature develop
  ```
  
- Finishing a feature:
  ```
  git checkout develop
  git merge --no-ff feature/awesome-feature
  git branch -d feature/awesome-feature
  git push origin develop
  ```

- Starting a release/hotfix:
  ```
  git checkout -b release/1.2 develop
  // or
  git checkout -b hotfix/urgent-fix main
  ```
